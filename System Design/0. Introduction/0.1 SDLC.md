The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is the process of determining how an information system (IS) can support business needs, designing the system, building it, and delivering it to users. If you have taken a programming class or have programmed on your own, this probably sounds pretty simple. In the real world, however, it is not so easy.

The key person in the SDLC is the systems analyst, who analyzes the business situation, identifies opportunities for improvements, and designs an information system to implement the improvements. Many systems analysts view their profession as one of the most interesting, exciting, and challenging jobs around. As a systems analyst, you will work as a team with a variety of people, including business and technical experts. You will feel the satisfaction of seeing systems that you designed and developed make a significant positive business impact, while knowing that your unique skills helped make that happen.

The systems analyst role focuses on the IS issues surrounding the system. This person develops ideas and suggestions for ways that IT can support and improve business processes, helps design new business processes supported by IT, designs the new information system, and ensures that all IS standards are maintained. The systems analyst will have significant training and experience in analysis and design and in programming.
