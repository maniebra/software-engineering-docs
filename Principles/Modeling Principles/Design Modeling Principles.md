1. Design should be traceable to the requirements model.
2. Always consider the architecture of the system to be built.
3. Design of data is as important as design of processing functions.
4. Interfaces (both internal and external) must be designed with care.
5. User interface design should be tuned to the needs of the end-user. Stress ease of use
6. Component-level design should be functionally independent.
7. Components should be loosely coupled to each other than the environment.
8. Design representations (models) should be easily understandable.
9. The design should be developed iteratively.
10. Creation of a design model does not preclude using an agile approach.
