1. Be agile. Whether the process model you choose is prescriptive or agile, the basic tenets of agile development should govern your approach.
2. Focus on quality at every step. The exit condition for every process activity, action, and task should focus on the quality of the work product that has been produced.
3. Be ready to adapt. Process is not a religious experience and dogma has no place in it. When necessary, adapt your approach to constraints imposed by the problem, the people, and the project itself.
4. Build an effective team. Software engineering process and practice are important, but the bottom line is people. Build a self-organizing team that has mutual trust and respect.
5. Establish mechanisms for communication and coordination. Projects fail because important information falls into the cracks and/or stakeholders fail to coordinate their efforts to create a successful end product.
6. Manage change. The approach may be either formal or informal, but mechanisms must be established to manage the way changes are requested, assessed, approved and implemented.
7. Assess risk. Lots of things can go wrong as software is being developed. Itâ€™s essential that you establish contingency plans.
8. Create work products that provide value for others. Create only those work products that provide value for other process activities, actions or tasks.
