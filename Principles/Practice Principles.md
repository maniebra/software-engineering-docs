1. Divide and conquer. Stated in a more technical manner, analysis and design should always
emphasize separation of concerns (SoC). 
2. Understand the use of abstraction. At it core, an abstraction is a simplification of some complex element of a system used to communication meaning in a single phrase.
3. Strive for consistency. A familiar context makes software easier to use.
4. Focus on the transfer of information. Pay special attention to the analysis, design, construction, and testing of interfaces.
5. Build software that exhibits effective modularity. Separation of concerns establishes a philosophy for software. Modularity provides a mechanism for realizing the philosophy.
6. Look for patterns. Brad Appleton suggests that: â€œThe goal of patterns within the software community is to create a body of literature to help software developers resolve recurring problems encountered throughout all of software development.
7. When possible, represent the problem and its solution from a number of different perspectives.
8. Remember that someone will maintain the software.
