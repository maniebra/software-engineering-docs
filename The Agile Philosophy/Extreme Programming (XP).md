# Description
**Extreme Programming (XP)** is a **software development methodology** that focuses on **improving software quality** and **responsiveness to changing customer needs**. It promotes **frequent releases**, close collaboration with the customer, and continuous improvement through short development cycles and regular feedback.

# Core Principles
- **Communication** – Developers constantly talk with each other and with stakeholders to keep everyone on the same page.
- **Simplicity** – The team only builds what’s needed right now; no over-engineering.
- **Feedback** – Frequent releases and constant testing provide fast feedback.
- **Courage** – Developers are encouraged to make bold changes, like refactoring or discarding failing code.
- **Respect** – Team members trust and support one another.


# Key Practices

## 1. Pair Programming
Two developers work together at one computer—one writes code while the other reviews it in real-time. They switch roles frequently, which improves code quality and spreads knowledge across the team.

## 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Tests are written _before_ the actual code. This ensures that every part of the software is covered by automated tests and behaves as expected.

## 3. Continuous Integration
Code is integrated and tested multiple times a day. This helps catch issues early and keeps the project in a constantly working state.

## 4. Small Releases
The product is released in small, frequent versions. This allows the customer to see progress and give feedback early and often.

## 5. On-site Customer
A real user (often a business representative) is available full-time with the development team to answer questions and provide guidance.

## 6. Refactoring
Code is regularly cleaned and improved without changing its behavior. This keeps the code-base simple, flexible, and easy to maintain.


# When to Use XP
- Requirements change frequently.
- The team is small (typically less than 10 developers).
- The project needs to deliver working software quickly and continuously.
- Close collaboration with users is possible.


# Benefits of XP
- High-quality, well-tested code.
- Fast response to change.
- Strong team collaboration and shared knowledge.
- Early and continuous delivery of value to users.


# Challenges of XP
- Requires strong discipline and team coordination
- Doesn’t work well with large or distributed teams.
- Needs full commitment from the customer to be on-site and involved.
