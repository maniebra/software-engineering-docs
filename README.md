# üõ†Ô∏è Software Engineering Docs

Since I am studying software engineering, I encountered many concepts and ideas that every software engineer needs to know. Hence, I decided to compile them all into one repository that my peers and beginners can use.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the directory as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.
3. Enjoy!
