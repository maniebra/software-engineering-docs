| Process Model               | When to Use                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waterfall                   | When requirements are well understood and unlikely to change                             |
| V Model                     | When high reliability and thorough testing are required                                  |
| Incremental                 | When there is a need to deliver parts of the system early and get feedback               |
| Unified Process (UP)        | When the project is large, complex, and requires iterative development                   |
| Component-Based Development | When reusable components are available or the system can be built from them              |
| Formal Methods              | When correctness and mathematical precision are critical (e.g., safety-critical systems) |
| Aspect-Oriented Design      | When cross-cutting concerns like logging or security need modular handling               |
